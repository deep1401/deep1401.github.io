  &lt;p&gt;The following article is an overview of my understanding of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethics.fast.ai/syllabus/#lesson-1-disinformation&quot;&gt;Lesson 1: Disinformation&lt;/a&gt; taught by &lt;a href=&quot;https://rachel.fast.ai&quot;&gt;Rachel Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. It also represents my notes for the course and also an attempt at a blog post series to increase awareness about various concepts in fairness and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-disinformation&quot;&gt;What is Disinformation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, we come across various articles, memes or any other content while browsing social media that we consider as “fake” or “misleading”. These articles could’ve either purposely been posted on the platform to mislead users or it could’ve been a genuine mistake by the poster. This results in untrue information being forwarded to the audience either purposely or as an accident. Thus in such cases, there could be 3 major forms of information which can be observed from the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;float:right&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/misinfo-diag.png&quot; alt=&quot;misinfo-diag&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/06/how-misinformation-spreads-on-twitter/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, we can observe that the most dangerous kind of information to receive from such platforms or any source for that matter is disinformation as it is intended to harm the receiver deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the next point to observed is if this harm is intended by the algorithm processing the information or by the poster of the information. Intuitively, we have been wired to believe that algorithms are the ones who misinterpret everything and cause the spread of disinformation. This is not a general case but has been proven as the truth in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-studies-on-misleading-information&quot;&gt;Case Studies on Misleading Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Latanya Sweeney Ad Discrimination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first example is about the bias generated by digital ads while looking for various people on search engines. This was observed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://latanyasweeney.org&quot;&gt;Dr.Latanya Sweeney&lt;/a&gt; who is a professor at Harvard. While looking for her name on a search result, she found ambiguous ads such as the ones stating “Latanya Sweeney, arrested” and then she decided to investigate these search results. After conducting an experiment involving around 2000 variations of various names, she concluded that the search engine ads were biased towards a certain community of people and would show such results in order to increase the click rate. This was also properly summarised in the paper written &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2460278&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. An example of comparing such results can be observed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;float:left&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/sweeney1.png&quot; alt=&quot;sweeney1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2460278&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a clear bias can be observed by the search results and the resulting ads. However, on asking the ad posters regarding the same, a claim was made that for every ad, both copies of the results as observed in the figure were submitted. On observing various ad clicks, the algorithm learnt that African-American names should be assigned one of the two submitted variations and similarly for all other names, a bias was introduced. Thus, in this case, the algorithm was at fault. This could be borderline classified as ‘misinformation’ on the human side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Houston Protest Trollification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; May 2017, two non-violent groups of protestors gathered at the Islamic Da’wah Center in Houston. One of these groups was holding the signs stating that &lt;em&gt;“White Lives Matter”&lt;/em&gt;. This group was led to believe that the new library in the religious center was publicly funded and thus, this group came to protest the opening for the same. The other group of protestors showed signs in support of the opening stating slogans like &lt;em&gt;“Muslims are welcome here”&lt;/em&gt;. Even though, the protest wasn’t violent, there was high tension among the people present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the twist to this story was that the real instigators of this protest weren’t even present in the country at that time. They were sitting at their homes in St.Petersburg, Russia. It was also found that the coordinators of these two Facebook events were two seemingly polarized Facebook groups — one called the “Heart of Texas” with 250,000 likes, and the other titled “United Muslims of America” with 320,000 likes. But a federal investigation into Russia’s influence on the 2016 election had linked both accounts to the same St. Petersburg troll hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, this is the case where people spread a form of &lt;strong&gt;disinformation&lt;/strong&gt; in order to create chaos and harm 2 distinct groups of people. This is a major problem that has to be dealt with the increase in the usage of these social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-on-disinformation&quot;&gt;More on Disinformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at various such examples, it can be said that disinformation isn’t just about spreading fake news. It also includes memes, videos, social media posts. All of this is spread in the form of rumors, hoaxes, propaganda, misleading content, misleading context. It should be noted that it is not wise to use the terms “fake news” and “disinformation” interchangeably. As we observed with the case studies too, disinformation leads to misleading content majorly and not necessarily only fake content. Thus one should be careful while referring to disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation also doesn’t just necessarily refer to one single content entity. It could be a whole campaign of planned manipulation of an entire community. There is a general framework to how this manipulation is carried out and how it reaches the masses. This framework proposed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/dr-claire-wardle&quot;&gt;Dr. Claire Wardle&lt;/a&gt; was called “Trumpet of Amplification” and can be represented as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trumpet-claire.png&quot; alt=&quot;trumpet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/1st-draft/5-lessons-for-reporting-in-an-age-of-disinformation-9d98f0441722&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trumpet represents how any misleading information starts with anonymous websites such as 4chan or 8chan. After this the information is passed on and starts doing rounds on social media networks such as Whatsapp, Telegram or Facebook Messenger groups. After gaining some traction, it is posted and shared on various conspiracy groups on Reddit and even YouTube videos are made on the same. After this, the influential social media handles start covering these misleading information tracks and thus, eventually it results in being covered by social media. Due to such widespread of this misleading information already, the end stages of the trumpet aren’t able to verify completely the authenticity of the information at times. Such frameworks often undermine democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-issue-of-verification&quot;&gt;The Issue of Verification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a very good piece in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/zeynep-tufekci-facts-fake-news-verification/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://sils.unc.edu/people/faculty/profiles/Zeynep-Tufekci&quot;&gt;Zeynep Tufekci&lt;/a&gt;. This piece is regarding the verification of facts and the threat of surveillance arising out of it and was written as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When people argue against verification efforts, they often raise the issue of authoritarian regimes surveilling dissidents. There’s good reason for that concern, but dissidents probably need verification more than anyone else. Indeed, when I talk to dissidents around the world, they rarely ask me how they can post information anonymously, but do often ask me how to authenticate the information they post—“yes, the picture was taken at this place and on this date by me.” When it’s impossible to distinguish facts from fraud, actual facts lose their power. Dissidents can end up putting their lives on the line to post a picture documenting wrongdoing only to be faced with an endless stream of deliberately misleading claims: that the picture was taken 10 years ago, that it’s from somewhere else, that it’s been doctored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-leak-authenticate&quot;&gt;Hack, Leak, Authenticate!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An information dump or leak is generally when a load of documents are leaked online. One such example of the information dump is the “Hilary Clinton email leak” which came into light during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often in such cases, misuse of information could happen in two ways. One of the ways would be misrepresenting or mixing fake documents in a large dump of real documents. Due to the quite accurate nature of the real documents leaked, the audience would often fall into a state similar to the hot hand fallacy principle and believe all documents to be real. This is what happened in the case of the attack and leak of World Anti-Doping Agency data during the cyberattack by a Russian hacker collective called Fancy Bear. This hacker group was agitated as there were talks of barring Russian athletes from the Olympic games due to the doping incidents. Thus, they leaked the test documents of several athletes who had received therapeutic use exemptions, including gymnast Simone Biles, tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and basketball player Elena Delle Donne. Thus, such athletes were portrayed in the wrong light and Russia was portrayed as the victim. This was later proven to be false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other method of manipulation is Narrative Laundering. This method is when a story is made up out of the real documents. The story is often misleading or even fake and generally uses certain specific facts from the documents to prove its authenticity. An example of such incident would be if only a certain excerpt was considered from a medical paper and the treatment was provided using that method. Thus, even if the original paper would’ve said later on that this particular method in the excerpt is not recommended, the excerpt signifies something else and thus, misleads the audience who are fed this laundered story. Even generalisation of facts taken from similar medical papers, which have experimented only on a certain sub-group of population and not the whole world leads to improper practices and may cause fatal results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;virtual-content-real-influence&quot;&gt;Virtual Content, Real Influence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking at social media content, we often find out based on the earlier case studies that these systems promote and incentivise disinformation. Since we don’t really live in an Orwellian world right now, it would be safe to say that this is a design flaw and isn’t done purposefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social Media Networks are designed in such a way that instant feedback (quantified in the form of # of likes) is instantly rewarded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consuming more content leads to the algorithm assuming satisfaction in that particular category and thus, recommending content without further verification or a general feedback loop to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business models designed to increase user consumption also push these propagandas of disinformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was rightly said by Renee DiResta, Mozfest 2018 @ noUpside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our political conversations are happening on an infrastructure built for viral advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such content is also used to heavily influence humans consuming the said content. Humans often drop a viewpoint when faced with extreme criticism and thus, this leads to easier manipulation of the audience when there’s already a prominent community supporting a misleading context point. This can also be observed in case of the KKK (Ku Klux Klan). When a particular neighbourhood participates in such racially discriminating practices, the people who are open-minded start receiving backlash and thus, give-in to such extremist thoughts and the use of social networks amplifies this factors as it is very easy to generate a fake “fan following” with the help of fake accounts and whatnot.
This can be represented by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Extreme viewpoints can be normalized when we think there are others around us who hold the same views”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very good question raised during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethics.fast.ai/syllabus/#lesson-1-disinformation&quot;&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt; was that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If Big Tech companies build effective tools to detect such fake accounts or extremist propaganda accounts and shut them down completely with the help of their superior engineering workforce, wouldn’t it lower the daily active user count significantly and would that in turn make them hesitant in taking action?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is indeed a very good point to think about as not every organisation is 100% evil or even 100% ethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-know-the-problems-now-how-can-we-solve-them&quot;&gt;We know the problems now, how can we solve them?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-pinterest-pandemonium&quot;&gt;The Pinterest Pandemonium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently during the Covid19 pandemic panic, there was a huge fallout regarding the authenticity of vaccine and the people identified as anti-vaxxers were dubious about what was in the vaccines as they were created rather quickly according to them. This led to such groups relying on the mighty social media articles, the utmost “reliable” sources of information for these vaccines. In order to prevent the spread of disinformation, Pinterest implemented a feature in which any such vaccine query would be redirected automatically to verified sources such as CDC, WHO, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this didn’t go as expected. The redirection led to the anti-vaxxers becoming more paranoid and believing that the vaccines did have something to hide which the “higher-ups” didn’t want them to know. Also, this revealed that such authoritarian control was possible on such social media networks to the extent that content search was completely manipulated (even if it was done for good). Thus, giving authoritative power to social networks is definitely not the solution to ending disinformation and infact, this could be the factor which might increase dissent among the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ctrl--f-solution&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ctrl + F&lt;/em&gt; solution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at the intricate faults of such humongous networks, the users could increase the digital literacy among themselves. The ultimate verification of any article or any digital content for that matter can be carried out by the people consuming them in a sheer duration of 30 seconds. The approach to do this was proposed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/holden&quot;&gt;Mike Caulfield&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;lessons.checkplease.cc&quot;&gt;Check, Please!&lt;/a&gt;. This approach is often considered to be better than researching various other websites and finding more misleading information on the same topic. This course could be used as an exhaustive method to verify doubtful content and thus, decreasing the disinformation being spread among the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A point can be raised that since the approach is that simple, why is it not automated and built into the networks themselves. Although, it is true that the approach is simple but it is very context specific and it would be better if the users run the test themselves instead of scanning the content. Though scanning the content would be considered okay on public platforms such as Twitter but it isn’t accepted on end-to-end encrypted platforms like Whatsapp as this would lead to a possible leak in the sensitive messages and thus, the app would lose its crucial usability feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;large-scale-issues&quot;&gt;Large Scale Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a large scale level, even information-centric platforms like Wikipedia have appointed fact-checkers who verify the content posted. However, on observing the revision history on such platforms, one can observe that there is an arms race going on between the disinformationists and the fact-checkers. Thus, it is the responsibility of the tech companies as well as the consumers to fight this serious problem and prevent critical circumstances such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://americasquarterly.org/article/misinformation-is-threatening-brazils-elections-too/&quot;&gt;Brazil Election Issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Early warning, this is not a success blog post.

2020 has been a completely unpredictable year for me. It started when I was completely clueless about my life
and now 11 months later, I can safely say that I'm a little less clueless about this year. It all started in January,
I didn't know what I really wanted to do with my life and I just kept learning random technologies to find out what I really want to specialise in.

## What happened after that? (The GSoC debacle)

Well, it kept going on like this and then came February. GSoC projects and organisations were announced. Me and my friends talked to some seniors who had already been part of the cohort the previous year and decided to try out in the open source world this year. I was a bit naive and new to the GSoC world and thus, I shortlisted only one organisation (CERN), I know this was a bit ambitious (code for very ambitious). However, I really liked the [Rucio](https://github.com/rucio/rucio) project and the Native Language Processing project. Being a newbie, I had never worked on such an advanced NLP project. All I had ever tried in NLP was a basic sentiment analysis tutorial. So, I learnt the necessary concepts and completed the evaluation tasks assigned to me. The mentors at Rucio were really helpful and solved all my stupid doubts at any time of the day. So, being very excited I put together a decent solution to all the tasks assigned in just 7 days.

Just after this, the whole country went under lockdown and I was stuck at a relative's house in another city. Unknown to the fact that I might be there for a very long time, the date of the final proposal submission came close and as I had described my solution to just be above mediocre, I was hesitant to submit it. But, some of my friends encouraged me to submit it and thus, I did. Not long after that, I got the review of my evaluation task and it was a very good review. That was exactly the confidence boost I needed amidst the chaos going on all around the world. Later, I found out that my solution was not in the top 3 solutions received and thus, I wasn't selected for the GSoC program that year.

However, the upside to this was that looking at the top 3 solutions, I actually felt excited to learn all the concepts and methodologies used by the very able developers and researchers. That was the first time I realized this could be the field to explore in depth as I had wanted since the beginning of the year.

## What Now? (The CFG experience)

Now, I got back home in the month of June. I had already started doing [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md) and [NLP](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/) courses by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai). This was the time when I got the notification that I had been shortlisted for the Code for Good hackathon organized by [JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/us/en/students/programs/code-for-good). This was indeed good news because right from the lockdown, I hadn't gotten any exciting projects to work on and hackathons are a plethora for good projects and great networking opportunities. The Code for Good hackathon was just that. With the very helpful mentors and NGOs as our clients, we started this 12 hour hackathon to build a solution for the client. The rigorous experience and the pressure of committing to the deadlines reminded me of all the hackathon fun we have during such periods, getting the modules to work right until the last minute. This was just that and reminded me that CS was indeed the right choice for me. We managed to get to the final round, however we couldn't bag the winning prize. Despite of that, I had the most amazing time during the lockdown period with some really awesome people as teammates.
ps. I integrated some NLP features for the final product too. I was having fun learning that now :)

## What Next? (The High School Return)

While all this was happening, I had started preparing for the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) in order to support my profile for grad school application which is essentially a couple of years away. I could say that I had some extra motivation now as I had some idea about the specialization that I wanted to get into after my undergrad. I started preparing quite rigorously during the end time and would read and solve various Verbal and Quant questions in order to increase my accuracy. After learning almost 1800 words and going back to the high school level math exercises, I felt that JEE pressure again after quite some time. After all, this was a competitive exam and I have been taught since the 11th grade that if you don't ace a competitive exam, you're essentially a failure in life (which is not true btw). So, I gave it my all and gave the exam around September. I was really happy with my score and it felt like this is it.

## Oh wait (I skipped one important thing)

So, the thing I forgot to write about is that before the lockdown, my professors presented me and a peer of mine with an opportunity to contribute a chapter for a technical journal. Being a newbie, I was completely scared and that's why I accepted the invite. Now the lockdown happened and we found out in around July that the editors liked our abstract and we had to start writing the final chapter to submit for further review. Thus, began a month of rigorous research. Although, the project we were writing the chapter on was completely built but, the writing part was more daunting to us as we'd never done it before. After a month of reading numerous articles, some very deep mathematical theory and whatnot, we were able to finish the chapter which is under review right now. But, this experience like everything else mentioned above was important to me. This helped me grow not only as a programmer but also as a student.

## What's your point?

I have read a lot of posts blaming this year and so I wanted to write a version of mine. I wouldn't ever blame the year 2020 as it has been kind of a turning point for me and helped me discover and experience some of the memories that I'm going to cherish forever. Right from playing some board games (believe me I was an expert at those) to building some great projects and learning some amazing concepts, this has been an amazing year. The biggest thing I'm going to take away from 2020 is:

&gt; Wherever you are in life, you always gotta keep learning!

Have an amazing year or what's left of it and also an amazing 2021!</content><author><name>Deep Gandhi</name></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html">The Beginning</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Motivation for this Blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/motivation-for-this-blog" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Motivation for this Blog" /><published>2020-07-05T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-07-05T15:30:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/motivation-for-this-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/motivation-for-this-blog">## Why is writing necessary a part of tech?

Recently, a friend of mine started his own [blog](https://jashmehta3300.github.io) and me being curious asked him why?
At that point he showed me some famous blogs by [Anish Athalye](https://www.anishathalye.com) and [Rachel Thomas](https://www.fast.ai/topics/).
Both of these, are people that we admire and follow a lot and then he explained to me the importance of blogging by mentioning a quote from Rachel Thomas

&gt; You are best positioned to help people one step behind you. The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner (or an intermediate) and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you’re writing about.

## An introduction to me and my journey till now!

So since you are here, you might know that my name is Deep Gandhi. I am currently a Computer Engineering undergrad at D.J.
Sanghvi College of Engineering. However for me, engineering has not been just a degree but more of a self-exploration period.
Finding out what I love to do and then doing that as long as I can.
Someone once rightly said:

&gt; it's a truly lucky man who knows what he wants to do in this world, because that man will never work a day in his life.

I guess that's what we're all looking for in life, tech, etc.

Okay, enough philosophy now!

## Let's talk tech?

So my interests primarily lie in the field of Data Science. That is one of the major reasons why I made up my mind to start this blog.
I have a lot of juniors and peers as well who are interested in getting into this field but Data Science being a lucrative field,
people often run scams in the name of courses and a lot of my contemporaries have fallen for these scams and wasted a lot of
money.
My belief is that if we're trying to teach ourselves programming then we should find a way to learn everything for free. It's an
open source world after all :P
But, my point here isn't to be a know-it-all but to write blogs so that my juniors know things that **I wish I knew last year**.
You know so they don't waste their time and make the same mistakes. After all, it's all about helping the person right behind you!

So I'm gonna end it here and I promise to keep it to the point in the upcoming ones :P (hope so)
My blogs are going to be about a lot of topics and I'll just list down some of them below:

- Projects that I build
- My journey through this amazing tech world
- My GRE prep

and many more to come....

That's all for now!</content><author><name>Deep Gandhi</name></author><category term="Getting started" /><summary type="html">Why is writing necessary a part of tech?</summary></entry></feed>
